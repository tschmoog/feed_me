Initial readme. 

This is a project to automate as much of the selection of recipies and the procurement of ingredients for those recipies. 

The ultimate goal is to set parameters (time, calories, diet type, cost) and have returned a set recipies, shopping lists and potentiialy a schedule that lets one prepare ahead for upcoming meals. E.G. Reminder to marinate ingredient 'x' the night before.
